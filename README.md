# The-Entrapment-Problem-in-Arminian-Theology-A-Trinitarian-Crisis
Rigorous exegetical critique of classical Arminianism's "Entrapment Problem": universal resistible grace that God knows will fail, yet punishes. Argues synergism distorts the Trinity and constitutes "another gospel" (Gal 1:6-9). Targets systematists and apologists, not laypeople.
